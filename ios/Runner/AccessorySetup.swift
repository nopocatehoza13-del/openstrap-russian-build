/// AccessorySetupKit (ASK) bridge — iOS 18+ only.
///
/// WHY: TN3115's relaunch table has two rows that are "No" without ASK and "Yes" with it —
/// "App Force Quit by the user" and "Control Center Bluetooth button toggled". Note 5:
/// "Starting in iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, only apps that use AccessorySetupKit to setup
/// Bluetooth accessories will be relaunched." Apple DTS has since clarified on the forums
/// that note 5 scopes to *those two rows only* — it is a capability apps GAIN, not one they
/// lose, and the ordinary relaunch cases (app removed from memory, crashed, device
/// restarted) never depended on ASK. The condition is also stated per-APP, not
/// per-accessory; the relaunch itself still fires "if and only if" a pending Core Bluetooth
/// request completes, which is what BleRestoreManager holds.
///
/// So the load-bearing reason to route pairing through the picker is simpler than
/// "otherwise no background sync": on iOS 18+ this picker IS how a user grants us the
/// accessory, plus those two extra relaunch cases.
///
/// COEXISTENCE: ASK is a provisioning/authorization gate, NOT a connection owner. It hands
/// back `ASAccessory.bluetoothIdentifier` — the CoreBluetooth peripheral UUID, which is the
/// exact value flutter_blue_plus uses as `BluetoothDevice.remoteId` on iOS. So after the
/// user picks the band we just return that UUID to Dart; flutter_blue_plus connects to it
/// exactly as before. No second GATT owner, no conflict.
///
/// Dart MethodChannel `openstrap/accessory_setup`:
///   - `isSupported`        -> Bool   (true only on iOS 18+)
///   - `provisionedIds`     -> [String] (every ASK-provisioned accessory's uppercased UUID)
///   - `provisionedId`      -> String?(uppercased UUID of an already-provisioned band, or nil)
///   - `showPicker`         -> String (the band provisioned by THIS call; throws on cancel/error)
///                             optional Bool argument: true = add another accessory
///   - `removeAll`          -> nil    (deprovision all — used on unpair)
///
/// The service UUIDs the picker matches on are NOT duplicated here: they come from
/// Info.plist's NSAccessorySetupBluetoothServices, which Apple requires to list every
/// descriptor criterion anyway, and which is generated from `kBandRegistry` by
/// `tool/gen_ios_ask_plist.dart`.
