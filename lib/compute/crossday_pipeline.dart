// CROSS-DAY PIPELINE — the cross-day analytics rollup (PURE, ISOLATE-SAFE).
//
// The per-day pipeline (onehz_pipeline.dart / deriveDayBundle) writes ONE
// derived bundle per physiological day. A whole family of tested analytics
// (illness CUSUM, multivariate anomaly, CTL/ATL/TSB load, skin-temp illness,
// the true Phillips SRI across days, social jetlag, chronotype, sleep debt,
// percentile-of-you, glass-box readiness, breathing-rate-variability) operate
// on a SERIES of days and were never wired in. This module gathers the recent
// day series and runs those families ONCE per derivation pass.
//
// PURITY: this file does NO DB/IO, no Flutter, no DateTime.now(), no Random —
// every input is supplied by the caller. The ONLY DateTime use is
// DateTime.parse(date) to read the calendar weekday for the free/work split,
// which is a deterministic function of the input string. Safe for Isolate.run
// and directly unit-testable.
