// notification_event.dart — the single currency of the notification system.
//
// Everything that wants to reach the user (illness onset, recovery ready, a
// wind-down nudge, a step goal) is expressed as ONE NotificationEvent and handed
// to NotificationCenter.emit(), which decides whether it fires an OS
// notification based on the category + the user's NotificationPrefs. (There
// used to also be an in-app notifications feed/screen — removed; OS
// notifications are the only surface now.)
//
// Categories map 1:1 onto OS notification channels (see notification_service)
// so Android users can mute each kind independently. Priority drives the
// quiet-hours decision: `critical` can break through; everything else respects
// the user's quiet window.

///
/// The app used to be able to emit ~22 distinct kinds across four channels:
/// hydration slots, step goals, posture nudges, "your recovery is ready", AI
/// briefings, an unconditional weekly recap. Sixteen of them were nudges, none
/// aggregated, and a wrist band that buzzes twenty times a day is a band people
/// take off. The rule is now one class per REASON to interrupt:
enum NotifClass {
  /// The band alarm the user armed. It fires on the strap's own RTC, so the
  /// phone notification is a report, not the alarm itself.
  alarm,

  /// Something is wrong right now and the user can do something about it —
  /// the day's aggregated health exception, and the band's own failures (flat
  /// battery, gone quiet). One notification, not one per finding.
  exception,

  /// The weekly lookback, and ONLY when the week actually contained something.
  lookback,

  /// Something happened that only the user can confirm, and the app cannot
  /// record it for them: an auto-detected workout. Not a nudge — a nudge asks
  /// you to go and do something, this reports a thing that already happened and
  /// asks whether to keep it. One per detected bout, never a reminder series.
  ///
  /// It gates exactly like [exception] today (category switch + quiet hours),
  /// which is deliberate rather than redundant: this enum is the ledger of what
  /// may interrupt, and filing "did you work out?" under `exception` would make
  /// the one honest list in the notification system lie.

  /// v8: a WHOOP-style observation from the Familiar feed, promoted to a push.

  /// observation id, quiet hours apply. Keyed on its route, never on a
  /// category, so nothing else can ride it.

/// sites express: health/device signals are exceptions; a `reminders` event at
/// `critical` is the alarm (nothing else is allowed to claim that pair); the
/// `recovery` channel carried "your recovery is ready" and "did you work out?",
/// both nudges, and its genuine findings (low readiness, a shifted resting-HR
/// trend) are folded into the day's health exception at the point they are
/// computed rather than fired one at a time.
///
/// The ONE exception to classifying on the category alone is the detected
/// workout, which is keyed on its route. It is a reminders-channel prompt at
/// normal priority, and that pair has to keep meaning "no" for everything else
/// — it is the pair every one of the nineteen deleted nudges would arrive on.
/// So the route names the single event allowed to claim it, rather than the
/// gate opening for a whole category. `shouldFireOs` already reads the route
/// for the same reason (the auto-detect off switch).
