// Pair a second sensor: scan, pick one, write the `device` row.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The whole decode-and-store path for a standard Bluetooth
// heart-rate sensor shipped, tested, and unreachable: `HrsLink.arm()` reads a
// `device` row and nothing ever created one, so every call returned false and
// the feature was a library with no door. This is the door.
//
// WHY IT IS GENERIC OVER A [BandEntry] AND NOT ABOUT STRAPS. The scan filter,
// the candidate list, the picking, the characteristic check and the `device`
// row are the same work for every notify-class band; the only part that
// differs is what happens between "user tapped a row" and "the row is
// written" — for a strap, nothing, and for a ring, a key exchange against a
// factory-reset device. So that step is the ONE injected parameter
// ([onPicked]) and everything else is shared. A second copy of this screen per
// band is how the copy, the honesty rules and the iOS gate below drift apart.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
//  * Not a background scan. It scans while it is on screen and stops.
//  * Not a connection owner. The pairing connect is dropped as soon as the row
//    is written; `HrsLink.arm` opens the real session when a workout starts.
//  * Not a promise that anything derives from the sensor. `kDerivableSources`
//    is empty (ASSUMPTIONS R6): a paired sensor CAPTURES, and its seconds bank
//    and sync and appear in diagnostics while producing no metric at all. The
//    copy on this screen says so rather than implying a recovery score.
//
// THE iOS GATE is the part worth reading twice — see
// `HrsLink.scanHeldBackReason`, which carries the evidence. Starting a scan on
// an iPhone whose WHOOP is not yet paired creates a `CBCentralManager`, and
// AccessorySetupKit's picker refuses to open while one exists. That is
// recoverable by restarting the app and by nothing else, so the screen says it
// out loud BEFORE scanning and lets the user decide, rather than discovering it
// later as a WHOOP that cannot be paired for no visible reason.
