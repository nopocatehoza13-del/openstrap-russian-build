// BEATS — the RR-derived family, as pictures.
//
// This app recovers beat-to-beat intervals from the band's 1 Hz records and
// computes a whole family off them: Poincaré geometry, per-bin nightly RMSSD,
// PRSA deceleration capacity, an irregular-rhythm screen. Until this screen
// existed all of it rendered as rows of numbers on Nerd stats, at a density
// most people never open. Nothing here is new arithmetic — every value on this
// screen was already computed and already persisted. What is new is that the
// three of them that are SHAPES are finally drawn as shapes.
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// PRSA's averaged profile. The brief for this screen asked for deceleration
// capacity as a waveform, "which is what `prsa_dc_anchors` is for". It is not:
// `prsa_dc_anchors` is the ANCHOR COUNT, and `PrsaResult.profile` — the actual
// averaged waveform — is dropped by `toJson`, so nothing persists it. Even if
// it did, the pipeline runs PRSA at l = 2, so the profile is FOUR samples. Four
// points is not a waveform and drawing it as one would claim a resolved
// deceleration shape we do not have. DC is trended as a number instead.
//
// The apnea / cyclic-variation panel. It was asked for as "a visible
// oscillation in the tachogram" and it cannot be drawn honestly:
//   * no cycle TIMES are persisted — `CvhrResult` keeps counts, means and
//     quartiles, so there is no stretch of night to zoom to;
//   * at whole-night scale one horizontal pixel is ~80 s and a CVHR cycle is
//     10–120 s, so any curve here would be sub-pixel texture that a reader
//     would over-read as "the pattern";
//   * every summary that IS drawable is a per-night value, and a per-night
//     value is exactly what RESP-01 forbids on this surface.
// The honest form — the 30-night personal distribution — already exists on Nerd
// stats under Respiratory rate, and stays there. Four panels that are true.
//
// ── THE RULES THIS FILE IS UNDER ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// * Deceleration capacity gets no threshold, no colour and no reference range,
//   ever. See `_dc`.
// * The rhythm panel is a SCREEN, never AF detection. No percentage of
//   abnormal beats, no arrhythmia vocabulary, "not screened" visually distinct
//   from "clear", and a permanent line — not a tooltip — that a clear strip
//   means nothing. See `_rhythm`.
// * gen4 and gen5/MG nightly RMSSD are not comparable; nothing here presents
//   two families as one series without saying so.
// * `rr_ts_ms` is still `rec_ts * 1000`, so it is not a beat clock. There now
//   IS one beside it — `decoded_rr.beat_ts_ms`, anchored on the record's
//   measured `tsSubsec` — but it is NULL for every row banked before that
//   column existed, because nothing stored the sub-second and the frames are
//   pruned. Nothing on this screen is drawn against a beat-level clock either
//   way: the scatter is intervals against intervals, and the night curve is
//   binned at half an hour. Anything that starts using `beat_ts_ms` has to
//   carry the null era, which is most of this database.
