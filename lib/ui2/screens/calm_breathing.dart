// Paced breathing — the one screen in the app whose job is to slow you down.

// The phase engine is `lib/stress/breath_phases.dart`, which is pure and
// shared with the interval timer. This screen owns only the clock: a `Ticker`
// hands it elapsed time, `phaseAt` turns that into a phase, and `BreathRing`
// draws the phase. Nothing here loops on its own — the design system bans
// `.repeat()` precisely because thirteen ungated tickers is what the old UI
// shipped, and a loop nobody owns cannot be stopped by the reduced-motion
// gate.
//
// Coherence needs live RR from the band. Breathing does not. When the band is
// not connected the pacer still runs; it just says plainly that there will be
// no score.
