// BODY CLOCK — the highest-value thing the pipeline already knew and nothing
// ever asked it for.
//
// Chronotype, social jetlag and the sleep-regularity index are computed every
// cross-day rollup and, until this screen, were read by nothing. The actogram
// is built here from the per-night sleep windows: one column per night, noon
// to noon, so a night reads as one continuous block instead of being cut in
// half at midnight.
//
// The non-parametric rhythm family (interdaily stability, intradaily
// variability, relative amplitude, L5/M10) and the 24 h cosinor ARE computed —
// `crossday_pipeline.dart:_crossDayCircadian` emits `circadian_rhythm`,
// `circadian_cosinor` and `circadian_coverage` on every rollup. Their substrate
// is not the textbook one: the 1 Hz accelerometry is pruned after three days,
// so the battery runs on the per-day HOURLY HEART-RATE profile that `day_result`
// keeps forever. That makes M10/L5 the highest- and lowest-HR windows rather
// than step counts, and the card says so out loud rather than letting the
// numbers imply accelerometry.
