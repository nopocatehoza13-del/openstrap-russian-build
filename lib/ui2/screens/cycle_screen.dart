// CYCLE — the domain that was fully built in the data layer and dark in the UI.
//
// Three rules shape every line of it:
//
//   1. Everything on this screen is COUNTED from days you logged. The phase
//      and the prediction are arithmetic over your own dates — no threshold,
//      no population norm, no diagnosis. THERE IS NO FERTILE WINDOW: it was
//      `(median − 14) ± 2`, a textbook population constant printed as her own
//      dates, and WH-09 deleted it. The one thing the repo derives from a
//      sensor (`ovulation_est`, a temperature coverline) is deliberately NOT
//      rendered either: it compares an ADC-count threshold against a z-score
//      series, a live unit mismatch.
//   2. A prediction states its evidence and never hardens into a promise. It
//      is a RANGE — the median gap ± the MAD of her own gaps — with the number
//      of measured gaps behind it on the same row. It is often very wide, and
//      that width is the finding. It disappears entirely below two logged
//      starts, and below THREE it can only give the point and say why it has
//      no width.
//   3. The biometric overlay is descriptive and comparative to YOU. Resting
//      heart rate across the current cycle, drawn from `day_result`, with no
//      claim about what it means.
//
// Tracking is off until the user turns it on, and the switch lives here rather
// than in a settings screen — the toggle and the thing it toggles are one tap
// apart.
//
//   4. NO ANOMALY SURFACE MAY BE RENDERED ON THIS SCREEN. not the health
//      exception, not the illness CUSUM, not a multivariate-anomaly card, not
//      an "elevated for N nights" row — however it is worded and whatever the
//      strings say. "your resting heart rate has been elevated for 10
//      consecutive nights" placed next to a late period IS a pregnancy
//      inference; the layout does the inferring and no copy edit undoes it.
//      the app must never infer, display, store or export a pregnancy
//      probability: a false positive is cruel, a false negative reaching
//      someone deciding about medication, alcohol or imaging is dangerous, and
//      an inferred-pregnancy field is a category of data with real legal
//      exposure in several jurisdictions even when it never leaves the phone.
//      keep the anomaly surfaces on their own screens. the only honest
//      pregnancy feature is a DECLARED state whose entire function is to make
//      the app say less, and a declared state stays out of exports and out of
//      any AI-briefing prompt — exports are allow-listed to views, so keeping
//      it out is one line, and it is worth a test.
