// What charged and drained you — readiness taken apart, in plain words.
//
// This screen printed two words and stopped: "hrv", "rhr". Two separate things
// were wrong and only one of them was the rendering.
//
//   · IT READ THE WRONG ARRAY. `readiness_glassbox.drivers` is the list already
//     FILTERED to the inputs that cleared the smallest-worthwhile-change gate,
//     so an input that sat inside your usual spread was not "hidden", it was
//     never in the array. The screen therefore could not say "and your
//     breathing rate did nothing", which is half of what "what changed" means.
//     This reads `breakdown` instead — all four inputs, each carrying its own
//     `used` flag, weight, signed contribution and spread gate. It is the same
//     array `ReadinessDetail` renders, so the two screens describe one
//     computation in one vocabulary rather than two.
//
//   · NOTHING SAID WHAT THE NUMBER WAS. Not the reading, not the user's own
//     usual, not the direction, not the size of the move, not whether the move
//     was bigger than the noise. Every one of those was already being computed
//     and written on every derive, in the `baselines` block — value, baseline
//     centre, spread, delta, MDC — and no widget in the app had ever read it.
//
// So nothing here computes. It joins three stored things — the glass-box
// breakdown, the baselines block, and each input's own stored series — and
// says them out loud. The arithmetic of a score, never an account of a person:
// a driver is a term in a formula we control, and the footer says so.
