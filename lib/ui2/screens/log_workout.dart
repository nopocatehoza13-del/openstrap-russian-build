// LOG A WORKOUT — the two places the athlete owns the times, and the review
// screen the auto-detector has been writing to for months with nobody reading.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. `LocalRepository.logManualWorkout` and
// `setWorkoutWindow` have been implemented, tested and reachable from the
// coach's tool layer since the manual-session work landed, and reachable from
// the app from nowhere: the UI rebuild deleted `lib/ui/workouts/` and lib/ui2
// never replaced this part of it. Back-logging a session, or widening one the
// detector clipped, meant asking a BYOK language model to do it for you.
//
// The same deletion orphaned `workout_suggestions`. The detector still fills
// that table on every derive; `activeWorkoutSuggestions()` had exactly one
// reader and it only ever DISMISSED. `kRouteWorkoutSuggestion` survived, the
// tab mapping survived, and the destination did not — so the deep link fell
// through `screenForRoute`'s `_ => null` and landed on the plain Workouts tab.
//
// ONE WRITE SEAM. Confirming a detected bout is not a special kind of write:
// it is a manual session over the window the detector proposed, so it goes
// through `logManualWorkout` like every other. That is what gets it a strain
// and a calorie figure scored from the 1 Hz substrate — the old confirm path
// hand-built a row with neither and every confirmed suggestion landed in the
// log showing blanks. It also retires the suggestion on its own, inside the
// repo, via `supersededSuggestionIds`.
//
// WHAT THE DETECTOR REPORTS. The hard-effort CORE, not wall clock — see the
// header of `compute/manual_session.dart`. An hour of mixed training routinely
// detects as ~25 minutes, which is correct for a prompt and wrong for a log
// entry, and is exactly why "Adjust the times" sits beside "Log it" rather
// than three screens away.
