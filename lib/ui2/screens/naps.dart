// NAPS — the day's naps, and the last word on them.
//
// `nap_min` has been populated on every judged day (232 minutes on one of
// them), the `naps` block has carried the windows behind it, and neither had a
// reader. Underneath, `sleep_nap` has had `putNapEdit` and `deleteNapEdit`
// since the detector became a PROPOSAL rather than a verdict — and no caller,
// anywhere, so `applyNapEdits` replayed a table that could never have a row in
// it. sleep_detail.dart says so in as many words: "a control that appeared to
// edit naps while the edits went nowhere would be worse than the absence. It
// needs a writer first."
//
// This is that writer, and it ships with the display for one reason: showing a
// nap and letting someone correct it are the same feature. A list you cannot
// argue with is the detector asserting it was there; the person who was
// actually there gets the last word.
//
// AN EDIT IS A RECOMPUTE, NOT A REDRAW. Nap minutes are subtracted from sleep
// need and sleep debt, so every write here forces the day to derive again —
// the same machinery a sleep-window correction uses, and the engine
// force-includes nap-edit days even when they are finalized.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: no stages. A 30-minute nap holds no complete
// cycle, the stager says nothing about one, and a logged nap is a REPORT, not
// an estimate — it gets no confidence, because dressing it in the detector's
// scale would imply it was inferred.
