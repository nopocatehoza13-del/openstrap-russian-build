// The way into a tab. Full-bleed, a mascot, and one number.
//
// One widget, two uses: Workout's "start a session" and Wellness's "start a
// sitting". They are the same card with a different accent, a different
// mascot and a different noun, so they are the same code — a second copy is
// how the two drift a corner radius apart and nobody notices for a month.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS GOT WRONG THE FIRST TIME, all of which a rendered check
// caught and none of which a reading would have:
//
//   · Full bleed was tried twice and both were wrong. A negative
//     `Container.margin` asserts (`margin.isNonNegative`) and painted a
//     358x100000 overflow stripe. An [OverflowBox] then blanked the entire
//     tab on device: inside a ListView the cross axis is bounded but the MAIN
//     axis is not, and an OverflowBox handed an unbounded height takes it,
//     which takes the whole list down with it.
//     So the card no longer bleeds ITSELF. The LIST drops its side padding and
//     gives it back to every other child — the card is simply the one child
//     that does not get it. Layout stays ordinary and predictable, which is
//     what a hero card at the top of a scroll view has to be.
//   · The mascot was in a `Stack` UNDER the copy, at 176 px inside a 190 px
//     box with no clip. The two fought for the same pixels and the headline
//     ellipsised to "71 activit…". It is a `Row` now: the copy takes the width
//     that is left and the mascot cannot reach it.
//   · The height was fixed at 190. At 2x text the play button clipped off the
//     bottom. It is a floor now.
//
// It is deliberately NOT in the gallery: every case there is laid out in a
// ~179 logical-px cell, and a full-bleed card photographed in one shows the
// fixture squeezing it rather than the card. `start_session_card_test.dart`
// renders it at a real phone width instead, which is where those three defects
// actually became visible.
