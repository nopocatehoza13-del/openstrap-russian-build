// The token boundary. Nothing below this file defines a colour, a size, a
// radius or a duration — everything else in lib/ui2 spends what is declared
// here, and `test/ui2_tokens_test.dart` fails the build if it doesn't.
//
// Three things this file owns that the previous design system did not:
//
//   1. CONTRAST IS SOLVED, NOT ASSERTED. Muted ink and every accent used as
//      text or as a fill are pushed to a WCAG AA (4.5:1) floor by `P.on` /
//      `P.fill`, against the worst surface they can legally land on. The old
//      caption token measured 2.20–2.71:1 across 223 call sites; a token that
//      *can* be misused eventually is. `test/ui2_contrast_test.dart` proves
//      the floor holds in both themes for every accent.
//   2. MOTION IS GATED ONCE. `motion()` and `animate()` are the only way to
//      get a non-zero duration, and they return `Duration.zero` when the
//      platform asks for reduced motion. No call site can opt out, and the
//      tokens test forbids `.repeat(` anywhere in lib/ui2 so an infinite loop
//      can never survive the gate. That gate reaches the NAVIGATOR too:
//      `buildTheme` installs a `pageTransitionsTheme` that returns the page
//      unanimated (22 routes were sliding at full duration under Reduce
//      Motion), and `sheetMotion()` does the same for the four modal sheets,
//      which do not consult a theme at all. Dialogs still use Flutter's own
//      fade-and-scale — small, centred, and the least nauseogenic of the
//      three — so they are deliberately left alone.
//   3. BOTH THEMES ARE DESIGNED. Every colour is defined for light and dark in
//      the same expression. There is no token that exists only inside a
//      dark-mode branch.
